The word ""butter"" comes from the Greek word βούτυρον (bouturon), which is a combination of βοῦς (bous), meaning ""ox, cow,"" and τυρός (turos), meaning ""cheese"". This suggests the earliest understanding of butter as a ""cow-cheese"" product. The Greek word was then latinized to butyrum, and eventually entered Germanic languages as ""butter"".

In America everything comes with fine print, you always have to read the fine print. The caveat is that they used race fuel, drag slicks, a prepped surface and a pro driver on a perfect day, going slightly downhill, and did several runs before the car overheated/falls apart, then they quoted you the best time they got and still rounded down.  When a German brand like Porsche gives you the quoted time it's a bare minimum the car will do with any driver in any conditions on any road any day at any time, over and over and over again. Those that know, know. Those that haven't figured it out by now, with all the information available online these days are just hopeless and or delusional."

pAKIF8tXi-w,@tristanburnett7529,Yes…
pAKIF8tXi-w,@Official-dz6gx,I have and always will clown on v6s never owned one and never plan on it they sound weird and most of the time bad reliability
pAKIF8tXi-w,@MatthewRoncetti,"$300K +, not sure how that’s “Low key..”"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@mercury7590,"Easy pick over the Lambo. It’s just as fast and has even more pedigree, plus it’s small enough to use on the daily if need be (plus it can go where the Lambo can’t, especially with a front axle lift system)."
pAKIF8tXi-w,@harlemknight120,Definitely has a Supercar price.
pAKIF8tXi-w,@TChighbury,Shirt courtesy of Douglas Reynholm
pAKIF8tXi-w,@megsman4749,I would buy a Porsche but I will only have a Lambo if given one.
pAKIF8tXi-w,@kvgames9358,Huracan
pAKIF8tXi-w,@prezaki226,Sports design and carbon roof better
pAKIF8tXi-w,@poopertrooperz,Prefer NA but porsche all day long baby
pAKIF8tXi-w,@fraomedinaii2095,I'm going to get this tomorrow when I get paid that clock that doubles as a stopwatch did it for me
pAKIF8tXi-w,@Ariel0607-b8p,Anyday
pAKIF8tXi-w,@nast-enola,"0:37 - Forrest Said:  "" You can delete your rear seats.""    !!LOL !! I would luv to meet you one day and chill !"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@enioladelano6680,6 cylinders ewww
pAKIF8tXi-w,@AnonYmous-mh2us,"just like lamborghini designs better. 
porsche has improved its interior tho,"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@DJG_Official,Yes. My answer is yes before you cover any specs and do any review
pAKIF8tXi-w,@floot727,"this thing goes 0-100 in 2.5s and from 110 to 0 in around 30m, AND it comes with adaptive all wheel steering. Yes, Yes I Will"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@somewhereinagalaxyfarfaraway,As someone who can't afford either I would pick this one 😅
pAKIF8tXi-w,@TripleBlack331,"I'm taking the Lambo over this, but if this was the Turbo Targa S, then I'd take it."
pAKIF8tXi-w,@ЛЕБО-ж9ъ,Yes all day YES
pAKIF8tXi-w,@bjo004,The features are so underwhelming 🥱
pAKIF8tXi-w,@dwaynethemineraljohnson412,Why woukd you ever delete the rear seats? To save a little weight? Even if you don't use the rear seats it just looks better with them
pAKIF8tXi-w,@egoisteofficial,"Porsche all day, every day."
pAKIF8tXi-w,@felinefriend6101,i would hands down….itl start every time
pAKIF8tXi-w,@Kenny_Random,A Porsche is more reliable than a Lamborghini and can be used as a everyday car
pAKIF8tXi-w,,Resale value alone should settle it.
pAKIF8tXi-w,@Infamous_wu13,"Tbh I’d take the Huracan only for the availability of modding the crap out of it, but if I wanted a daily it would be Porsche"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@linxz_cj7822,Now you gotta pet you car for it to open its trunk.
pAKIF8tXi-w,@pablitou5375,I mean the sound IS worse than a NA V10 but Porsche has a lot of advantages over a Huracán
pAKIF8tXi-w,@CameronSmithLanguages,"I never knew so many people liked porsches but yea I'll take porsche over any car (bmw, lambo, mercedes, etc) but it's all about personal preference"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@AndrewCollis-p7y,"That launch on that Porsche was butter smooth no slip, and no slide"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@iam6th963,Which one has a better chicken magnet?
pAKIF8tXi-w,@SydneyGavriel,Leona Lewis tho lol
pAKIF8tXi-w,@ethanseeletse,"Specifically the 911 turbo s over the Huracan, no but 911 st, yes"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@adystriaswan,its so sexc🤭 (i want one so bad.. or a targa)
pAKIF8tXi-w,@Theos-13,"And it has a PDK dual clutch, plus a 2.6 second 0-60!"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@amg863,"Lamborghini is more of a head turner. Probably makes you feel more special when you drive it because it's so exotic and uncompromising. 

The Porsche is the more reasonable choice. It is more reliable, more understated, more refined and practical. It really depends on your priorities. If you already have a track car or a fun daily, maybe what you want is a flashy lambo to spice things up on the weekend. For me the appeal of the Porsche is you can drive it everyday and blend in everywhere. You don't have to worry too much about it"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@angelowilson-vv3kb,Us need that exact one!!!
pAKIF8tXi-w,@AGENT-ho,No
pAKIF8tXi-w,@julianr6283,"Wow you learn something new everyday , never knew until could pop the hood with just a slide of ur hand"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@Nustart999,I would choose Porsche Drive Alfa want Audi Rs6 love Porsche
pAKIF8tXi-w,@romerosneck,No heated seats in a 200k car? Gtfo
pAKIF8tXi-w,@LeonardoSartor-g2p,Ok but... It sounds rubbish
pAKIF8tXi-w,@s3ated980,"Lower depreciation, higher top, better brand value what more u want"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@cco111,I’ll take the lambo…after I get a Porsche first.
pAKIF8tXi-w,@areswebb7145,"Cheers for publishing this! Hoping for some advice: My TRX Wallet holds some USDT trx, and I have the SEED: -clean- -party- -soccer- -advance- -audit- -clean- -evil- -finish -tonight- -involve- -whip- -action-. What’s the best way should I go about sending them to KuCoin?"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@habtamugulilat9066,"Well it depends if weather it the normal hurcan or sto
I mean if it is the normal hurcan I would choose the 911 turbo s
If it is the sto I would also choose the porsche 911 turbo s"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@same8825,"I'd choose this over virtually any other car in the world, except pagani and a few others"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@Budgie-Lovee,Nothing can beat german cars
pAKIF8tXi-w,@christophestrattman,"All day, everyday... PORSCHE FTW 💯"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@venkateshnaidu2133,Porsche any day!!
pAKIF8tXi-w,@alialmatawah5413,"Of course the 911 S there's really nothing to compare. The Porsche 911 is an icon that's quicker, more powerful, and ready to be built in a way that satisfies every emotion and taste"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@georgespalding7640,The pro athletes and the kids in their 20s are going for the Lamborghini. The middle-aged guys are going for the Porsche 911 S.
pAKIF8tXi-w,@idk-z8h,"Porsche, daily use obviously"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@cliftonmadden1992,Porsche Turbo S please!
pAKIF8tXi-w,@GoesBy_0,"Ngl I'd choose the Porsche, because i think that it looks better and i really love the rear end. And i can't ignore the fact that, every single clout chaser gets a Lambo as soon as he has the money"
pAKIF8tXi-w,@msne9191,Bro made a lambo guy angry 🙃
pAKIF8tXi-w,@LowsJuan,So your asking would you I buy a car built by VW or a car built by VW? I choose the latter. Platter.
pAKIF8tXi-w,@WashJosh,Is the GT4RS cheaper?
pAKIF8tXi-w,@Lord--Farquaad,Seems like it stacks up nicely in most important categories. But it's still not a Lamborghini. I like Porsche but a Lambo is just a different stratosphere.
pAKIF8tXi-w,@Rig.331,"Yes, yes I would"
NYifTXGwCOM,@beardthur,A v6 that destroys most v8s and is on par if not better than v10.is crazy
NYifTXGwCOM,@RoyalMooreAuto_Center,"My client Mr. Quagmire would like to know if the frunk can fit a yoga mat, a disco ball, and a legally consenting adult."
NYifTXGwCOM,@kurbiskern,i want this car so bad
NYifTXGwCOM,@tsebomoloi3410,"This is a properly engineered German car. Not the fragile BMWs, benzes and audis,although audi have improved their reliability."
NYifTXGwCOM,@SouthwestFloridarpgm,I will buy this car in the future
NYifTXGwCOM,@alextaylor29,Fantastic review this is on my eventual goal list.
